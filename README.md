## 1. Resources

If you're just getting started and want to learn the necessary tools going into this project, check out [resources.md](https://github.com/acmucsd-projects/sp23-ai-team-1/blob/main/resources.md)!

## 2. Getting Started

This is a project using NLP to classify a person's MBTI based on the tweets.

Our Dataset: [MBTI Personality Type Twitter Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mazlumi/mbti-personality-type-twitter-dataset)

## 3. Structure

* `Meeting-Notes` store all of our past meeting notes
* `img` are the images included in our presentations
* `models` include our trained models
* `resources.md` is a list of all the resources we reference throughout this project

Note: the package versions listed in requirements.txt and imported in the code may not be the exact versions. However, the versioning here is less important. I've listed all used libraries.

## 4. Requirements for Use

* python
* pytorch
* nltk
* cleantext
* textblob
* transformers


## 5. Difficulties

We spent hours on cleaning and preprocessing the original data, as the tweets usually contain tags, emojis, and other special characters. In addition, we have tp try many different models such as BERT to improve our model performance. Finally, we worked on website, using Streamlit, and designed it to make it more attractive and informative.
